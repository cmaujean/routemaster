Go script to use Route53 as dynamic DNS provider.

= Requirements =
* Go
* Route53 account with setup zone/domain name

= Usage =

Create file with AWS secrets somewhere
ex:
{
    "access_key" : "your access key",
    "secret_key" : "your secret key"
}

This implementation is loosely based off https://github.com/dreamins/Route53DDNS-ruby
This is my first Go lang program so I wouldnt trust it with anything important
